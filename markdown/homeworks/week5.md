- Fri 7/22:
  - No homework!
  - _**Please bring headphones or earbuds for Monday**_
  - Finish up any missing assignments from this week. If solution code has not been posted (or is not applicable, e.g. the user stories HW or material design HW) we will still accept them late. Please don't let yourself fall too far behind on your assignment completion percentage!
  - Suggestions for how to organize your thoughts for Project 2:
    - Finish your user stories if you haven't done them - know exactly what features you plan to implement
    - Draw your paper prototype & list out all the XML files you'll need
    - Plan your database tables and the corresponding custom Java classes to hold the data once you get it from your cursors
    - List all the adapters, fragments, view holders, etc. you'll need to make each screen work
    - Prioritize your features - don't work on bonuses before your main requirements are met!
