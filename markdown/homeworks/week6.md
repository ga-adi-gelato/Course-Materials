# Week 6 Homework

No homework this week besides working on Project 2. Projects will be due Friday afternoon, and everyone will demo their project for the class.

Suggestions for how to organize your thoughts for Project 2:
  - Finish your user stories if you haven't done them - know exactly what features you plan to implement
  - Draw your paper prototype & list out all the XML files you'll need
  - Plan your database tables and the corresponding custom Java classes to hold the data once you get it from your cursors
  - List all the adapters, fragments, view holders, etc. you'll need to make each screen work
  - _**Prioritize your features - don't work on bonuses before your main requirements are met!**_
  - _**Before working on a new feature, make sure your app builds and runs successfully - don't start working on feature #2 if feature #1 is still crashing!**_
