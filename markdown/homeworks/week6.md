# Week 6 Homework

- Mon 7/25 thru Thu 7/28: No homework besides working on Project 2. Projects will be due Friday afternoon, and everyone will demo their project for the class.


- Fri 7/29:
  - **Submit your Project 2 pull request!** We're still missing a handful.
    - If you're missing requirements, keep working over the weekend! New commits you push will be added to the open pull request automatically.
    - You need to show us you can implement the required features, but don't fall behind next week because you're still distracted by Project 2. Make the most of this weekend!
  - Do you have old, partially-complete labs & homeworks you never submitted? **Submit them now!** We may be able to give you credit for some, but we can't if you never submit them.
  - Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YcW25PHnAA) as a preview for next week on REST APIs, JSON-formatted data, and OAuth authentication.
