Suggestions for how to approach your projects:
- Write user stories - know exactly what features you plan to implement
- Draw a paper prototype & list out all the XML files you'll need
- Plan the custom Java classes you'll need to hold your app's data, and the corresponding database tables (if applicable)
- List all the adapters, fragments, view holders, etc. you'll need to make each screen work
- _**Prioritize your features - don't work on bonuses before your main requirements are met!**_
- _**Before working on a new feature, make sure your app builds and runs successfully - don't start working on feature #2 if feature #1 is still crashing!**_
