# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Whiteboard Practice - Linked Lists

## Exercise

Team up in groups of 2 or 3 and take turns working on the following problems. Pretend you are in an interview setting:
- Keep talking!
- Ask questions (to the instructors, or to your teammates)
- Consider starting with an example, showing the expected outputs for sample inputs
- Consider writing pseudocode before Java to make your steps clear to both you and the interviewer

#### Requirements

Take turns working through these problems on the whiteboard. It's OK if you don't finish them all. Make as much progress as you can.

Today's problems are from [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X), which is a great resource for whiteboarding and interview preparation.

1. Implement an algorithm to find the _kth-to-last_ element of a _singly_ linked list. The implementation of linked list you are using does NOT track the size of the list, i.e. you cannot do `position = size - k`.

2. Write code to remove duplicates from an **unsorted** singly linked list.

	Follow up: How would you solve this problem if a temporary data buffer (i.e. a separate data structure besides the linked list) was not allowed?


#### Deliverable

No deliverable - just practice working through problems out loud on a whiteboard
