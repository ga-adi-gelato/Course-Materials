## Exercise

Team up in groups of 2 or 3 and take turns working on the following problems. Pretend you are in an interview setting:
- Keep talking!
- Ask questions (to the instructors, or to your teammates)
- Consider starting with an example, showing the expected outputs for sample inputs
- Consider writing pseudocode before Java to make your steps clear to both you and the interviewer

#### Requirements

Take turns working through these problems on the whiteboard. It's OK if you don't finish them all. Make as much progress as you can.

Today's problems are from [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X), which is a great resource for whiteboarding and interview preparation. These are brain teasers, so you won't need to write any code, per se, but you may want to draw some diagrams and do some calculations to guide and explain your thinking.

1. You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 grams. Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle? You can only use the scale _**once**_.

2. There are 100 closed lockers in a hallway. You will make 100 passes through the hallway. On your first pass, you open all 100 lockers. On your second pass, you close every other locker. On your third pass, you "toggle" every third locker - if it's closed, you open it; if it's open, you close it. This continues so that on pass _i_ you toggle every _ith_ locker. After the last pass, when only locker 100 is toggled, how many lockers will be open?
	
3. There is a building with 100 floors. If an egg drops from the _Nth_ floor or above, it will break. If it's dropped from any floor below, it will not break. You're given 2 eggs and you need to find _N_. You can drop each of the two eggs multiple times, but of course once they break you cannot drop them again. How can you minimize the number of total drops you need to make with the 2 eggs while finding _N_?

#### Deliverable

No deliverable - just practice working through problems out loud on a whiteboard
