## Exercise

Team up in groups of 2 or 3 and take turns working on the following problems. Pretend you are in an interview setting:
- Keep talking!
- Ask questions (to the instructors, or to your teammates)
- Consider starting with an example, showing the expected outputs for sample inputs
- Consider writing pseudocode before Java to make your steps clear to both you and the interviewer

#### Requirements

Take turns working through these problems on the whiteboard. It's OK if you don't finish them all. Make as much progress as you can.

Today's problems are from [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/), which is a great resource for whiteboarding and interview preparation.

1. Write a function to reverse a string. Do not use `StringBuilder`'s `reverse()` method.

2. Write a function that takes a string and reverses the order of words but not the characters within the words. E.g. "The eagle has landed" becomes "landed has eagle The".

#### Deliverable

No deliverable - just practice working through problems out loud on a whiteboard
