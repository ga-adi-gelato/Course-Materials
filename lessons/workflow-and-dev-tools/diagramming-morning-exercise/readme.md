> ***Note:*** _This can be done in small groups or independently._

## Exercise

We're going to practice using diagrams to organize our knowledge and review our understanding of how various Android components work together. Creating diagrams can help do several important things:

- Catalogue your current knowledge (it's probably more than your realize!)

- Help you see connections between concepts/objects that you previously missed

- Identify specific gaps in your knowledge, allowing you to ask focused questions

There's no correct way to draw these diagrams. You can draw them in any way that makes sense to you. What's important is getting your thoughts down onto paper/whiteboard so you can begin to organize them.

#### Requirements

- Diagram a simple app that shows a list of strings in a ListView
  - Include objects such as your Activity, the ListView, the Adapter, etc.

  - List the relevant methods from each object which create other objects, use them as input, "set" them onto other objects, etc.

  - Draw arrows between objects & methods  w/ labels to indicate how they interact

- Next, diagram an app that shows data from a SQLite database in a ListView using a CursorAdapter

- Diagram an app that shows data from custom objects in a RecyclerView

**Bonus:**
- Add a second activity to one of the apps above which shows the detail for a single item from the ListView/RecyclerView

- Try to diagram something new: an app that shows data from a SQLite database in a RecyclerView (_hint: remember there is no ready-made CursorAdapter for RecyclerViews_)

#### Deliverable

You don't need to hand anything in, but for your own practice, try making these diagrams on paper or take photos of whiteboard diagrams. If you really want to go nuts with it, try making an electronic version with a tool like [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/).
